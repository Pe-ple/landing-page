## 🤷‍♀️ Why a community?
> There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about - Margaret J. Wheatley

### Develop a relationship with your fans
A community matters! Just ask any product or service with a strong following. Engaging with your fanbase will let you understand what *really* matters to them.

### Product innovation through user input
Listening to your community is essential to modern day product development. Some ideas from the community can be life-changing and will reinvigorate your product or service.

### Distributed knowledge sharing
Sometimes, your fans will know something that you don't about your brand or product. A community will give them an outlet to support each other. In large numbers, they can act as **your customer support** more effectively than your team can.
